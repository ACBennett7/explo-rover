Explo-Rover is a prototyping rover using an Arduino Uno,
an R/C car chassis, and various sensors and motor drivers. This is
a WIP repo as I am trying new things; eventually the tools here will
be used for various future projects like autonomous mowers, garden rovers,
and indoor automated cleaning rovers.
